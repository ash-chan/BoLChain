# Nightfall

Nightfall integrates a set of smart contracts and microservices, and the ZoKrates zk-snark toolkit,
to enable standard ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens to be transacted on the Ethereum blockchain with
complete privacy. It is an experimental solution and still being actively developed. We decided to
share our research work in the belief that this will speed adoption of public blockchains. This is
not intended to be a production-ready application and we do not recommend that you use it as such.
If it accelerates your own work, then we are pleased to have helped. We hope that people will feel
motivated to contribute their own ideas and improvements.


## BoLChain

BoLChain was built on top of the current Nightfall implementation. It mainly adds UI elements and API services for BoL tokenization. A demonstration video of how it works can be found in the drive [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17ojEARzvBLGYBPu1JmFHdKv3Sdz25Ibv).
>In order to deploy the tokenization microservices backend, run npm start in ebl-backend folder. \
>It will deploy a local NodeJS node on port 4000 along with a MySQL node for persistent storage. \
>The IPFS node used is an infura node on http://ipfs.infuro.io:5001 \
>The Swarm node used is the public swarm gateway.
